Description
-----------

Screen recorder is an Open Source library (under the [MIT Licence](LICENSE)) that allows you to record the screen from your Java code.

Nowadays, the library "only" records the screen into a .mov format, creating videos without audio using the minimum resources.

Getting started
-----------

### Adding dependencies


1. Add the repository:
```   
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>screen-recorder</id>
        <name>Java screen recorder library by agomezmoron</name>
        <url>https://raw.github.com/agomezmoron/screen-recorder/mvn-repo</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

2. Add the following maven dependency in your `pom.xml` file:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.agomezmoron</groupId>
    <artifactId>screen-recorder</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.3</version>
</dependency>
```
    
### How to use

It's very easy: 

 1. Configure the video interval in ms: by default it is 100ms (10 frames/sec).
 2. Configure the width/height or the full screen mode: by default it's full screen mode.
 3. Configure the video directory where the video will be saved: by default is the temporal folder.
 4. Set the *keepFrames* option into true/false if you want to keep the frames as .jpeg files: by defaul the library doesn't keep the frames.
 5. Call the *start* method passing the video name (ex: "myVideo" -> output: myVideo.mov).
 6. Perform your actions...
 7. Call the *stop* method

Example:

```
  // configuration
  VideoRecorderConfiguration.setCaptureInterval(50); // 20 frames/sec
  VideoRecorderConfiguration.wantToUseFullScreen(true);
  VideoRecorderConfiguration.setVideoDirectory(new File("~/")); // home
  VideoRecorderConfiguration.setKeepFrames(false);
  // you can also change the x,y using VideoRecorderConfiguration.setCoordinates(10,20);
  
  VideoRecorder.start("test");
  // EXECUTE ALL YOU WANT TO BE RECORDED
  String videoPath = VideoRecorder.stop(); // video created
  System.out.println(videoPath);
```

### How to use in TestNG

For TestNG you have a configuration class called *VideoRecorderTestNGConfiguration* which extends from *VideoRecorderConfiguration*. So, through it, you can configure the VideoRecorder and also some specific TestNG parameters:
 
 - VideoRecorderTestNGConfiguration.wantToRecordTest(true/false); // if you want to record your tests or not. By default is true.
 - VideoRecorderTestNGConfiguration.wantToKeepVideoOnSuccess(true/false); // if you want to keep the video once the test finished successfully. By default is false.
 - VideoRecorderTestNGConfiguration.wantToKeepVideoOnFailure(true/false); // if you want to keep the video once the test  failed. By default is true.
 
To enable the recording you only have to add the listener like:

```
   @Listeners({VideoRecorderListener.class})
   public class TestNGClass {
   
   	// if you want to configure the suite from each class
   	@BeforeClass
   	public void beforeClass() {
   		VideoRecorderTestNGConfiguration.wantToKeepVideoOnSuccess(true);
   		VideoRecorderTestNGConfiguration.setCaptureInterval(20);
   	}
    .....
   }
```

### VideoRecorder configuration

You can use the simple configuration or use your custom one defining the x,y coordinates and also the width/height size (by default, it records in full screen. Take care if before starting the video you have configured those options but you run *VideoRecorderConfiguration.wantToUseFullScreen(true);*, the previous configurations will be reverted.
